# My PCs and Hardware

## BAHAMUT - Custom-built Desktop

Purpose: Development, Gaming, Streaming

I use this desktop for development, gaming, media services, and hosting Virtual Machines. It is a power-house with plenty of RAM, an i7 990x Extreme CPU, and a water-cooled nVidia 1070 configuration.

### Pros
<ul>
    <li>Even though the i7 990x Extreme is considered old at this point, it still holds its own. I can be streaming four 1080p streams, running multiple VMs, and playing the latest games without even remotely pushing the cores to their maximum.</li>
    <li>With a PCIe performance SSD, SanDisk Performance SSD, dual 10k Raptors, and 35TB of externally attached storage, this thing feels like it never runs out of space.</li>
</ul>

### Cons
<ul>
    <li>Being a 4th generation Intel i7, it was extremely hard to find a new motherboard to replace my prior dead one with. Even then, I could only find refurbs and got one with two dead RAM slots, which was better than throwing away a CPU that originally cost $1000.</li>
</ul>

## ASUS ROG Strix Laptop

Purpose: Development, Gaming

I use this laptop for development and gaming if I'm on the road. It has a great balance between power and portability. With a desktop-grade nVidia 1060 inside of it and plenty of RAM and CPU to shake a stick at.

### Pros
<ul>
    <li>For the price, this is an excellent laptop for more-or-less anything. I even run up to 7 Docker VMs at a time without issue on it.</li>
    <li>Doesn't come loaded with tons of crap. ASUS puts the bare-minimum for applications and drivers pre-loaded, so you don't have tons of bloat-ware.</li>
</ul>

### Cons
<ul>
    <li>The touch-pad is dismal. Even after installing the proper drivers for gestures and pen-usage, the touch-pad is still frustrating to use.</li>
    <li>The case feels like it may twist and split if you pick it up with a single hand. It's not like a MacBook or SurfaceBook where you have one nice piece of metal. This does, however, allow for some future upgrades by allowing the buyer to add more RAM and SSDs.</li>
</ul>


## Dell PowerEdge 2900

Purpose: Advanced Firewall and Virtual Machines

I use this laptop for development and gaming if I'm on the road. It has a great balance between power and portability. With a desktop-grade nVidia 1060 inside of it and plenty of RAM and CPU to shake a stick at.

## Acer Predator X34 Curved Gaming Monitor

When my dual 27" monitors started failing after 7-years of use, I decided it was time to treat myself to a nice monitor, considering I sit in front of the thing almost all day long. I was hesitant to go back to a single monitor, but I must say, with the ultra-wide resolution, you can easily fit three windows side-by-side, where-as they would each consume a full 1080p display prior.
