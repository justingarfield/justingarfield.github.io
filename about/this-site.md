# About: This Site

It has been almost 15-years since I started a web app/site from scratch and had to deal first-hand with the intricasies of HTML/CSS/JS. My last full-experience was back when the term SPA wasn't even a thing, and CSS 2.1 was "the latest and greatest".

Since that time I've had UI/UX teams involved conjuring up all the styles and markup to conform to company style-guides and internal component/layout frameworks. This is nice and all, but I figured a LOT has probably changed 

## Goals

* Learn some new patterns and methodologies for modern design
* Keep file sizes small and avoid bloat
* Needs to be easy to add/update articles
* Keep as much public as possible so others can learn
* Avoid using Cookies if possible
* Easy to read and navigate on mobile devices and tablets
* Stays free with no obnoxious advertising
* See what life is like with Internet Explorer no longer existing &#128524;

## Things I learned

* https://fonts.google.com/ is a thing [1]
*  The Google search engine treats a hyphen as a word separator but does not regard an underscore that way. [2]
* `<meta>` elements which declare a character encoding must be located entirely within the first 1024 bytes of the document. [3]
* What the `viewport` meta tag _actually_ does and why [4]
* You can hide/show elements based-on `:checked` when they aren't direct siblings (used to need JavaScript for this) [5]
