# Projects -> Kubernetes

I originally started using Docker Compose to run containerized solutions, but after hitting 10-15 containers, I started to become overwhelmed with the amount of overhead involved in maintaining that much "stuff", with only more to come!

This led me to Kubernetes to help control some of the chaos.

This project area covers the steps and information found to build-out my own home cluster.

## Future Plans

Evenutally I want to utilize Sidero Metal to netboot/provision my Talos Linux nodes. Unfortunately at this point in-time, I just can't seem to get my Raspberry Pi 4s to exhibit a repeatable set of steps to always get a guarunteed netboot / Talos installer to run. This makes things a tad flakey in regard to future upgrades, re-installs, replacements, etc.

I did get fairly far with Sidero Metal in my testing, which I've left here for anyone else to peruse in hopes it might help someone.
