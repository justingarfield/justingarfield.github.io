# opnSense Hardware Configuration

I'm currently using two refurbished Dell R320 servers for my opnSense firewalls. They're a little beefy, but they suit me well.

Each server has 4 x 3TB SAS HDDs in a RAID5 array.

Each server has also been upgraded with a 4-port SFP+ Intel Server NIC to support trunks and state replication via PFSync.
