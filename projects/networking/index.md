Here I'll breakdown some of the notes and ideas I've used over time to build-out my home network. Each layer of the OSI Model is explained, as well as links to reference material, products, etc.

In order to document my home network, I use a combination of GitHub-flavored Markdown (*.md) files, Grphviz diagrams, and Mermaid flowcharts.
