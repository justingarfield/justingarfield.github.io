## In This Section

I've decided to go with four Raspberry Pi Model 4B SBCs to run my Sidero Metal and Kubernetes Control Plane nodes for my main home cluster.

As for my worker nodes, I'm currently running one beefy old desktop node until I can afford a few Intel NUCs or something of the sort.

## The Raspberry Pi 4Bs

Each Raspberry Pi consists of the following parts:

* [Raspberry Pi 4 Computer Model B 8GB Single Board Computer](https://a.co/d/6uCG5Ra)
* [Crucial MX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5 Inch Internal SSD](https://a.co/d/fCmzvEc)
* [CanaKit 3.5A Raspberry Pi 4 Power Supply with PiSwitch (USB-C)](https://a.co/d/b5KFrwz)

To keep things tidy and protect the Pis, I ended up purchasing this:

* [UCTRONICS Pi Rack Pro for Raspberry Pi 4B, 19" 1U Rack Mount](https://a.co/d/aZkqJtO)
