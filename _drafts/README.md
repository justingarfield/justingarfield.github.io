# Sidero Metal

## Overview

Welcome to my adventures building a Kubernetes Cluster with Talos OS, Sidero Metal, Raspberry Pi 4Bs, and an old-ish desktop PC.

This documentation provides additional observations and details for the official [Talos Linux] and [Sidero Metal] documentation in the hopes of helping others out there get up and running with Sidero and Talos OS in home (or other) environments.

This documentation covers:

* Overview of my hardware invovled in this configuration to help understand that side of it
* Provisioning of a Sidero Metal single-node install on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
* Provisioning of a Talos OS-based Kubernetes Control Plane
* Provisioning of a Talos OS-based Kubernetes Worker Node (old desktop PC)

This is part of a multi-part series:

* [Part 1 - Introduction](../README.md) <-- You are here
* [Part 2 - Hardware Preparation](docs/hardware-preparation.md)
* [Part 3 - Software Preparation](docs/software-preparation.md)
* [Part 4 - Sidero Metal](docs/sidero-metal.md)
* [Part 5 - Talos OS]()
* [Part 6 - Provision a non Pi node]()
