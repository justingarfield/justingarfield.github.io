# Overview
Today, I will be diving into the details of what it takes to get Blizzard’s Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness running, including multi-player support, on today’s modern computers. I have successfully followed these steps on multiple computers without problems. If you happen to have issues, please post them in the comments for all to see, and hopefully we can all pitch in and help each other out. Mileage may very, as we’ll be using a DOS Emulator to launch the game. You may be asking yourself, why this guide over any other? The answer is quite simple…time. I had to dig through over 15 different forums and newsgroups to piece together all of the information contained in this document, as well as trying different emulators and environments to get it running properly. I’m also very familiar with MS-DOS and emulation of operating systems as well, which helped correct a lot of mistakes made in other examples of how to pull this off.

# Background
In the days of old, before Windows 3.x even existed, we were living in the world of MS-DOS. In order to play any bleeding-edge game, it took enormous effort to configure sound, input, communications devices, and more. Today, the same holds true if you wish to play some of those same games.

# Prerequisites
Warcraft II Media .BIN File
A lot of emulators recommend using a .BIN image of the media for games. The ensures that the DOS emulator doesn’t have any I/O issues that could occur while trying to read from a physical CD-ROM drive. If you’re unfamiliar with creating .BIN/.CUE files, simply download one of the programs below and read the instructions on their site to get up to speed. You’ll then need to create a .BIN file by placing the Warcraft II CD in your CD-ROM drive and generating it from that, or by copying the files to a folder on your local machine and generating it using that (I had to use this method since Firestarter FX had issues ripping the CD due to some smudges).

# Warcraft II Patch
You aren’t required to patch, however, to ensure the most stable play of the game, I would highly recommend doing this in-case any performance improvements, bugs, etc. got fixed throughout the life of the game.

# D-Fend Reloaded
This is a GUI for the DOS emulator, [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com/). I recommend installing this over DOSBox standalone, because it’s easier to explain/troubleshoot with a broader audience and makes for an easy introduction to the emulator.
