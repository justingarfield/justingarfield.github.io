title: DP-900 - Microsoft Certified - Azure Data Fundamentals
---

Having passed my AZ-900 - Microsoft Certified - Azure Fundamentals the day before, I decided to keep my luck going and decided to give the DP-900 exam a go for Azure Data Fundamentals.

Using the materials available at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals/, I was able to brush up on a few topics that were new since I last played around with Data Lakes, Data Pipelines, and all that fun stuff. The materials were enough to once again give me the confidence needed to pass the exam.

Just wanted to take a minute to share with everyone that, as-of today I now have my Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Fundamentals certification!
