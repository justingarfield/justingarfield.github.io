excerpt: I got my Microsoft Certified - Azure Fundamentals Certification
---

It had been a while since I officially certified in anything, and I wanted to make sure the Microsoft Azure skills I had picked-up over the years were proper, on-track, and not way out in left-field. Can't hurt to have official certifications during a job hunt either!

Using the materials available at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-fundamentals/, I was able to brush up on a few topics that were new since I last built-out an Azure solution, and gained the confidence needed to pass it.

Just wanted to take a minute to share with everyone that, as-of today I now have my Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals certification!
