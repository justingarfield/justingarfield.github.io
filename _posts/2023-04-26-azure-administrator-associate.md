title: AZ-104 - Microsoft Certified - Azure Administrator Associate
---

I've worked with Azure in multiple capacities since it was generally available (Classic resource model). Most of my time building-out solutions has been either under-duress, or on shoe-string budgets which didn't allow me to fully embrace what Azure provides. In order to make sure my Azure skillset was on the right track (so to speak), I decided to sit down and work through the [AZ-104 exam materials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-administrator/) for Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate.

I'm excited to share with everyone that I passed today and have knocked this one out as well!
