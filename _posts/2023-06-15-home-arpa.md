## Use Cases

* What happens if I take my laptop to a family member's house and jump onto their home network?
  * RFC7368 states Discovery Services should take care of this *possibly*
* If I use a registered domain, what happens if I forget to renew it?
  * Anything that somehow bypasses internal DNS (DoT or DoH) could resolve poisoned routes pointing to someone else's hosts. Can't happen with `home.arpa` since it gets blackholed on the root servers w/ no delegation
