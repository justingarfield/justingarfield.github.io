## Overview

I've had four Raspberry Pi 4 Model B devices sitting around the house for a few months now.

I finally decided to build a personal Kubernetes Cluster Control Plane out of them using Talos Linux.

Before getting in too far, I wanted to make sure I had a clean and secure way to place the Pis in my equipment racks since they have exposed GPIO pins and what-not.

After hunting around the web for a few hours, I decided to go with the [UCTRONICS Pi Rack Pro for Raspberry Pi 4B, 19"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B6TW81P6) enclosure.

## The Pi Rack Pro



## The Pi 4 Kits

I purchased all of my Pi 4Bs as part of [CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 8GB Starter Kits](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08956GVXN).

At this point, I only use the heatsinks and power adapters.

## SSDs

For my build-out, I'm using [Crucial MX500 1TB SSDs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078211KBB) for the USB-SSD connectivity included as part of the Pi Rack Pro.

## PoE Hats

Just wanted to note that the [UCTRONICS PoE HAT for Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V33PG18) **does not** fit in the Pi Rack Pro _(you will be unable to slide the units in/out of their respective slots)_.
